# refactor-firstchallenge

I've changed the title element in the header to Horiseon instead of "website" to improve SEO opportunities

I reviewied every link within the header to make sure they were fully functional and only one wasn't as it was missing the id component (specifically the first one - search-engine-optimization)

I've added the alt= atribbute to the images to ensure the page is properly accessible

I've made sure the HTML file contains elements that follow the semantic rules of HTML grammar such as header, main, article, aside and section. 

I've made sure CSS is updated after changing the elements in HTML. I've merged a few declarations that shared the same selector rules and class to tidy and clean the code up a bit 

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
