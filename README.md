# refactor-firstchallenge

I've changed the <title> in the header to Horiseon instreaad of "website" to improve SEO opportunities

I reviewied every link within the header to make sure they were fully functional and only one wasn't as it was missing the id component (specifically the first one - search-engine-optimization)

I've added the alt= atribbute to the images to ensure the page is properly accessible

I've made sure the HTML file contains elements that follow the semantic rules of HTML grammar

I've made sure CSS is updated after changing the elements in HTML
