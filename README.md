# refactor-firstchallenge

I've changed the <title> in the header to Horiseon instead of "website" to improve SEO opportunities

I reviewied every link within the header to make sure they were fully functional and only one wasn't as it was missing the id component (specifically the first one - search-engine-optimization)

I've added the alt= atribbute to the images to ensure the page is properly accessible

I've made sure the HTML file contains elements that follow the semantic rules of HTML grammar such as <header>, <main>, <article>, <aside> and <section>. 

I've made sure CSS is updated after changing the elements in HTML. I've merged a few declarations that shared the same selector rules and class to tidy and clean the code up a bit
